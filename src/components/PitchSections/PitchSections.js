                <p>Congressional staffers and representatives have told us nothing is more powerful in helping a representative know what their constituents want than written letters and phone calls.</p>
                <p>Based on this fact, an effort called Project Grand Canyon was born. Just as the Grand Canyon was excavated one water drop at a time, our Members of Congress’ resistance to climate solutions will be worn down by the drip, drip, drip of thousands of phone calls per month.</p>

                <p>We began as a group of Citizens’ Climate Lobby (CCL) volunteers from Central Texas and are expanding Project Grand Canyon to serve CCL chapters throughout the United States.</p>
                <p>CCL is a non-profit, nonpartisan, grassroots organization focused on national policies to address climate change.</p>
                <p>CCL's consistently respectful, nonpartisan approach to climate education is designed to create a broad, sustainable foundation for climate action.</p>

                <p>Each month, thousands of Americans call their U.S. Congressperson respectfully urging congressional action on climate change.</p>
                <p>Together, volunteers form a slow, steady stream of calls, day after day, eroding their Congressperson’s resistance to climate solutions.</p>

                <p>CCL volunteers in Minnesota (photographed at the U.S. Capitol) have been implementing Project Grand Canyon since Spring of 2017.</p>
                <p>Their Member of Congress at the time, Jason Lewis, had been resisting meeting with CCL. After all the calls, the Member invited CCL for an hour long meeting.</p>
                <p>In their words, <i>Did we convert him in one meeting? NO. Did we educate him? Absolutely. Our MOC encouraged us to "keep it coming," and our liaison started to have regular contact with him.</i></p>
